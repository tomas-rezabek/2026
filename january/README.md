# January 2026 – Infrastructure Foundations

Focus areas:
- Linux services & boot dependencies
- Mail infrastructure (Postfix, Dovecot, queues)
- Monitoring (Loki, Promtail, Grafana)
- WordPress performance & IO
- Automation with Ansible
- nginx, php-fpm, caching & benchmarking

Key outcomes:
- Built automated server provisioning with Ansible
- Replaced Plesk workflows with code
- Implemented FastCGI + opcache and measured impact
- Designed resilient mail flow with queue testing

Biggest lessons:
- Boot order and dependencies matter
- IO latency can dominate performance
- Caching must be measured, not assumed
- Automation saves hours and reduces errors
