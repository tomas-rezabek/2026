did just one task in boot.dev to keep the streak, Database Normalization, Data redundancy is important

- created docker compose with Loki, Promtail linked to Grafana, router is sending syslog to promtail -> Loki -> Grafana,
now on my home network I can see how many connections firewall dropped per second or TOP IPs, Ports, intesity etc.

later will upgrade to pfSense (security with routing) -> ntopng (bandwidth, network usage) -> loki (syslogs) -> grafana (visualisation)
