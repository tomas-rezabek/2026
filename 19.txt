did one simple boot.dev task to keep the streak so far
practiced via docker compose WordPress initialization, initially it was slow because
it was reading data through wsl -> windows, moved the directory to linux only and
it became fast again, recovered wordpress backup for mtt consulting, waiting for andreea,
also started scanning 980k .cz domains for wordpress files, so far found 85587 .cz
sites that have WordPress
during the day managed to do a ticket related to apartmentbrno, apartmentpalava
overall productive day imo
